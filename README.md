## Rationale
I wanted a clean, simple and responsive website where I could store my random thought, showacase some fun projects and to generally let people know me more. It had to be fast and easily maintainable which is why I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as my main development framework. This is the result!

## Quick start
1. Use Git to clone this repo.
2. Make sure you have [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and hugo-extended installed.
3. To build the site and serve it: `hugo server -D`.
4. Visit `http://localhost:1313` to test it.

## Technologies
1. Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This website is completely static with only basic HTML or Markdown for everything.
2. Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
3. PositiveSSL provided by [Sectigo](https://sectigostore.com/ssl-certificates/positivessl).
4. Domain registration and management using [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).
5. Design is a mix of [FeelIt](https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt) and [hugo-developer-portfolio](https://github.com/samrobbins85/hugo-developer-portfolio) theme.
6. I used [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/), [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/) icons and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for styling.
7. I used vanilla Javascript for behaviour.
8. I'm using [UptimeRobot](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/jgLl6TjBYK) and Google Analytics for monitoring and metrics.
