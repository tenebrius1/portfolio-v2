## What is ShopBud?

ShopBud is a web app that integrates multiple online shopping assistants/apps (tracking of order, expense tracking, group buy) into one unified web app so that it is a one stop experience for end users.

## My Contributions

The bulk of my contributions goes towards the back-end work where I handled things such as the setting up of Heroku for deployment, handling communication of data from back-end to front-end, as well as assisting with some front-end work to make our app more intuitive.

## Main takeaways

1. Hosting PostgreSQL database on the cloud using Heroku Postgres.
2. Creating an onboarding experience using [intro.js](https://introjs.com/).
3. Streamlining registration/log in process by integrating social login using [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).
4. Documenting my work formally and learning Markdown and [AsciiDoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/) in the process.
5. Learning the basics of web scraping and tying out multiple tools such as [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) using a headless chrome/firefox browser, [requests-html](https://docs.python-requests.org/projects/requests-html/en/latest/) library and also [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). This was originally meant for a price tracker feature which we ultimately discontinued as e-commerce sites such as Amazon and Shopee actively blocks web scraping activities and we could not for the life of us figure out how to get past them â˜¹.
